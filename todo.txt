ideas:

show payments grouped by account and item
payment gateways integration.
make it easy to make a charitable payment to a non-profit while using the app.
add scenario detail page that shows the creator and collaborators, a reset button, and links to the scenario-form, items-form, accounts-form and report
rework global-menu to show just a logout button and links to the scenario-detail, items-form, accounts-form and report
somehow indicate who is currently signed in and possibly viewing/editing the current scenario
after item page go back to account page and each account link goes to an detail page analogous to the item detail page
allow associating accounts with google/facebook accounts
create (more) detailed report on how the answers were arrived at, both in narrative and graphical form
keyboard shortcuts?
added/modified/removed meta-data
move login/create-account to back of flow?
find search icon for find-scenario page
use `check` utility
add notFound template

issues:

text is too large on desktop
remove autopublish package, manually setup subscriptions
remove insecure package
in older (mac os tiger) safari:
  scenario links don't work
  buttons after inputs are wrapped to next line
  &check; sequence isn't recognized
in FF:
  can't dismiss flash message w/ click
  buttons after inputs are wrapped to next line
in IE 7:
  SHOW-STOPPING ERROR: history.state.initial is null or not an object
in IE 9:
  &check; sequence isn't recognized
  1px extra margin below input row on forms
  - SHOWSTOPPER: Navigating to a URL with route parameters takes you back to home page. Errors in console: 
    You called Route.prototype.resolve with a missing parameter. "scenario" not found in params 
    SCRIPT5022: The route named "account-form" does not match the path "/" 
in IE 10:

tech debt:

use router helpers to generate links using `href` attribute rather than programmatically changing routes?
merge mobile design with desktop design
need more test coverage!
come up with more intuitive naming conventions in lib/finances.coffee

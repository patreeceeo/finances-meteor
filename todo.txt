ideas:

allow more than one payer per item
payment gateways integration.
make it easy to make a charitable payment to a non-profit while using the app.
add scenario detail page that shows the creator and collaborators, and includes items-form, accounts-form and report
somehow indicate who is currently signed in and possibly viewing/editing the current scenario
allow associating accounts with google/facebook accounts
create (more) detailed report on how the answers were arrived at, both in narrative and graphical form
keyboard shortcuts?
added/modified/removed meta-data
move login/create-account to back of flow?
find search icon for find-scenario page
use `check` utility
add help blurbs to each page that can be shown/hidden with one button press

issues:

text is too large on desktop
it's possible to specify more than one payer for an item
remove insecure package
in older (mac os tiger) safari:
  scenario links don't work
  buttons after inputs are wrapped to next line
  &check; sequence isn't recognized
in IE 7:
  SHOW-STOPPING ERROR: history.state.initial is null or not an object
in IE 9:
  &check; sequence isn't recognized
  1px extra margin below input row on forms
  - SHOWSTOPPER: Navigating to a URL with route parameters takes you back to home page. Errors in console: 
    You called Route.prototype.resolve with a missing parameter. "scenario" not found in params 
    SCRIPT5022: The route named "account-form" does not match the path "/" 
in IE 10:

tech debt:

think about DB migration!
merge mobile design with desktop design
need more test coverage!
come up with more intuitive naming conventions in lib/finances.coffee
refactor collection wrapper functions in finances.coffee b/c of manual publishing

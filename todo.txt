ideas:

on item detail page, also loop through items
after item page go back to account page and each account link goes to an detail page analogous to the item detail page
allow associating accounts with google/facebook accounts
each scenario must have only one owner account, when another account wants to modify a copy is created behind the scenes
merge mobile and desktop design, use mobile's flash message design

issues:

can't delete from UI
mobile responsive layout

tech debt:

need more test coverage!

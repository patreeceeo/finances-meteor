allow associating accounts with google/facebook accounts
merge mobile design with desktop design
keyboard shortcuts
beta access codes?
added/modified/removed meta-data
move login/create-account to back of flow
create (more) detailed report on how the answers were arrived at, both in narrative and graphical form

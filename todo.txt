ideas:

on item detail page, also loop through items
add small space between item name input and item amount input
after item page go back to account page and each account link goes to an detail page analogous to the item detail page
allow associating accounts with google/facebook accounts
each scenario must have only one owner account, when another account wants to modify a copy is created behind the scenes
merge mobile design with desktop design, keep mobile's version of flash

issues:

need to be able to create/find scenario from the UI

tech debt:

need more test coverage!
